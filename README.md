# Compressible Flow Solvers
## Solvers and functions for compressible flow problems (in Python)
- Includes equations governing the compressible flow of gases (air) for: variable area (isentropic) flow with or without shockwaves, Fanno (frictional) flow, and Rayleigh (heat) flow.

- Currently, there are four solvers:
    1. Solve for the Mach number of a shockwave that reflects off a wall.
    2. Solve for the position of a shockwave within a diverging or converging duct.
    3. Solve for the updated conditions of a Fanno duct given an inlet Mach number and duct parameters.
    4. Solve for the exit conditions of a Rayleigh duct.

## Package requirements
Currently no additional packages are required.
