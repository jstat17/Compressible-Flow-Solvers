# Compressible Flow Solvers
## Solvers and functions for compressible flow problems (in Python)
- Includes equations governing the compressible flow of gases (air) for: variable area (isentropic) flow with or without shockwaves and Fanno (frictional) flow.

- Currently, there are two solvers:
    1. Solve for the mach number of a shockwave that reflects off a wall.
    2. Solve for the position of a shockwave within a diverging or converging duct.

## Package requirements
Currently no additional packages are required.
